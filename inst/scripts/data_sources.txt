# Data Sources and Provenance

## Overview
The data files in inst/extdata are derived from our previous article:

## Data Files

### example.mzXML
- **Source:** Subset of LC-MS data from the Cell publication
- **Original data location:** Available from the corresponding author upon request as described in the paper
- **Processing:** The file was down-sampled to reduce size for package distribution
  - Original file contained full LC-MS run
  - Extracted a representative time window (1-5 minutes) for demonstration purposes
  - Reduced to ~100 scans for efficient testing and examples
- **Format:** mzXML (standard mass spectrometry data format)
- **Purpose:** Example data for demonstrating read_mzxml() and related functions

### example.mgf
- **Source:** MS2 spectra from metabolite annotation workflow described in the Cell paper
- **Original data location:** Available from the corresponding author upon request
- **Processing:** 
  - Selected 10 representative MS2 spectra from the full dataset
  - Spectra chosen to represent common metabolite classes
  - No modifications to peak intensities or m/z values
  - Reduced from full library for package size constraints
- **Format:** MGF (Mascot Generic Format)
- **Purpose:** Example data for demonstrating MS2 matching functions (ms2Match, getSpectraMatchScore)

## Reproducibility

To recreate similar example files from the original data:

1. Obtain original raw data files from the authors (contact information in the publication)
2. Convert raw data to mzXML using MSConvert (ProteoWizard)
3. For mzXML: Extract time range 1-5 minutes using tools like msconvert filters
4. For MGF: Extract MS2 spectra using MSnbase or similar tools and write to MGF format
